</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Reporting bugs</H4><P>
Bugs reports should be sent through the issue tracker at
<A HREF="https://github.com/OCamlPro/typerex/issues"><TT>https://github.com/OCamlPro/typerex/issues</TT></A> (or by mail). If the
problem is an uncaught exception (of the form &#X201C;Error:&#X2026;&#X201D;), make
sure to provide the full backtrace (available in the <CODE>*Messages*</CODE>
buffer). In addition to the action which triggered the problem, an
accurate description of your code (and configuration) will be helpful,
especially for a wrong result (for example, incomplete).</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">What about other editors and operating systems</H4><P>Eclipse support is planed in a near future. Some people have also
expressed interest in VIM support, so we pay attention to this too.
Windows support is also planed (there may not be a lot of work to do
for that).</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">How does it compare to other similar tools</H4><P>
Many other tools exist to improve the development in OCaml, and it is
not possible to describe each of them here. Generally, we believe the
refactoring and semantic grep capabilities of TypeRex to be the most
advanced, (except for the particular case of Oug, whose very
expressive graph description allows similar queries). Identifier querying
is slightly more powerful and robust than its equivalents in,
<EM>e.g.</EM>, Tuareg, OCamlSpotter, or OcaIDE, with some minor
differences in user interface choices. TypeRex does not yet have
graphical summaries as in ODT or OCaIDE, or build management. Syntax
coloring is more detailed and systematic than other solutions. Auto
completion is currently restricted to identifiers (and very approximate for
local identifiers), and does not support syntactic constructs such as
pattern matching (as was proposed in OcamlWizard and the latest
version of OCamlSpotter), but it is already quite accurate and
responsive on identifiers defined in other modules.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc16"></A><A NAME="htoc42">4.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Project setup / building annotations</H2><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Findlib configuration does not work</H4><P>
We are investigating possible issues with findlib itself.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">What are .cmt(i) files exactly required for</H4><P>
The binary annotations provide a semantic descriptions of (type-able)
source code, together with accurate location information. They are
used to know about binding in a large sense, for example applying a
functor to an argument somehow &#X201C;binds&#X201D; the functor&#X2019;s parameter&#X2019;s
signature members to the actual argument&#X2019;s members. Navigation and grep
will only range over binary-annotated code, which can generally depend
on libraries without requiring annotations for them, as long as cmi
files are available (with some loss of completeness
though). Completion can use .cmi or .cmt(i) files, but the latter (and
access to the source code) will enable comment showing. Syntax
coloring does not require any annotation at all, of course.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">How to enable TypeRex for developping the OCaml compiler</H4><P>
Just copy
<A HREF="http://www.typerex.org/pub/ocaml-typerex.patch">this patch</A>
into the main directory, and run
<CODE>patch -p0 -i ocaml-typerex.patch</CODE>, then rebuild the compiler
starting from the standard library (mandatory): <CODE>make clean</CODE>,
<CODE>make world</CODE>, &#X2026;Please note the following limitations:
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<CODE>ocp-type</CODE> will fail on camlp4 except for version 3.12.1
(for binary compatibility reasons). This does not impact the use of
TypeRex for the remaining of the compiler.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Including Camlp4 in the program is currently not possible.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Generated files (other than ocamllex/ocamlyacc) are not
detected, so don&#X2019;t expect a fully automatic renaming of <EM>e.g.</EM>
<CODE>List.iter</CODE>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The <CODE>Dynlinkaux</CODE> pack module is not correctly understood by
TypeRex (because its components are in another directory).
</LI></UL><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc17"></A><A NAME="htoc43">4.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Browsing and refactoring</H2><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">{module, value, &#X2026;} x not found [in load-path]</H4><P>
This means that some identifiers could not be resolved, and can occur
in many situations. For a toplevel module, this probably means a
configuration problem (check your <CODE>.typerex</CODE>).</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Grep, Cycle, and renaming sometimes lag</H4><P>
These command can take up to several seconds on large projects,
because some computations have to be done over the whole code. Most of
it is cached, though, to speed up subsequent invocations (caching
should be correctly invalidated on a cmt file basis).</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">&#X201C;Goto definition&#X201D; fails, but &#X201C;Grep&#X201D; finds the definition</H4><P>
This is expected if the identifier comes from, for example, an
included module, or a pack module (more generally if the identifier
is internally renamed by the OCaml compiler during type
inference). The grep (or renaming) algorithm takes these renamings
into account to collect the full set of relevant identifiers, so it is
currently more powerful.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Locations are shifted, TypeRex complains about unsaved files</H4><P>
TypeRex uses the Emacs auto-save mechanism to know about modified
buffers, so that it can usually re-align shifted positions
correctly. This is not a perfect solution though, and in particular,
possible auto-save files (<CODE>#file.ml#</CODE>) from older sessions will
confuse TypeRex, if they are more recent than the file itself. In
this case you should delete them.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc18"></A><A NAME="htoc44">4.4</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Syntax coloring</H2><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Coloring is sometimes inaccurate</H4><P>
The current implementation has exact lexing information, but only uses
heuristics for approximate syntax computation (because it needs to
work for syntaxically incorrect buffers). This solution is not perfect
and also suffers from some thresholds which are introduced to keep it
responsive enough.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc19"></A><A NAME="htoc45">4.5</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Auto completion</H2><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Completion is inaccurate for definitions in the current buffer</H4><P>
The current implementation of completion is semantic for external
compilation units (i.e., with a .cmt(i) or .cmi, but only lexical for
the current buffer, so this is expected.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Completion stops working</H4><P>
We still have to spot the cause of this problem. Reverting the current
buffer with <CODE>M-x revert-buffer</CODE> (after saving the file, of
course) should bring it back.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">Emacs deadlocks</H4><P>This is a known bug, which sometimes happen when typing during a
buffer&#X2019;s initialization. The solution is to run
<CODE>killall ocp-wizard</CODE> to kill the TypeRex server process (which
unlocks Emacs) and then restart it from the TypeRex menu.
